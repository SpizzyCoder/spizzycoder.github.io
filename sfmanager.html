      SFManager stands for <b><u>S</u></b>imple <b><u>F</u></b>ile <b><u>Manager</u></b>.<br>
      There are a lot file managers available like
      <a href="https://invent.kde.org/system/dolphin" class="link-info" target="_blank">dolphin</a>,
      <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar" class="link-info" target="_blank">thunar</a>,
      <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus" class="link-info" target="_blank">nautilus</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo" class="link-info" target="_blank">nemo</a>,
      etc.
      But I wanted a solution that works for the desktop as well as for the servers.
      There are some console based file managers like
      <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn" class="link-info" target="_blank">nnn</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc" class="link-info" target="_blank">midnight commander</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger" class="link-info" target="_blank">ranger</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/vifm/vifm" class="link-info" target="_blank">vifm</a>,
      etc.
      I also wanted a simple but powerful file manager.
      While the file managers listed previously are mostly simple and powerful, none of these file managers I liked 100%.
      Of course the incentive was there to program one myself.
      If you program one yourself, you know exactly how the filemanager behaves in different situations.
      I mean it can't be that difficult to program a file manager anyway (or so I thought).
      With all this in mind, I thought about what the file manager should be able to do.
      Basically, a file manager should only be able to <u>create</u>, <u>delete</u>, <u>open</u>, <u>move</u>, <u>rename</u> and <u>copy</u> files/folders.

      I was thinking how the filemanager should look like.
      I liked the principle of a double panel file manager.
      A double panel file manager is very practical in my opinion.
      With a normal file manager I often found myself starting two instances and copying or moving something from one to the other.
      With a double panel filemanager you don't have to do such things.
      One file manager I like the most is <a href="https://github.com/doublecmd/doublecmd" class="link-info" target="_blank">doublecmd</a>.
      Doublecmd is a double panel file manager.
      It is written in Pascal.

      <img src="imgs/doublecmd.png" alt="Doublecmd" class="img-fluid shadow-lg mt-5 mb-5">

      This is a typical double panel file manager.
      At the bottom of the window it has different operations that you can perform.
      These are also bound to the F keys.
      You can even have multiple tabs open on one panel.
      My file manager should have many practical functions.
      For example, I could include the <a href="https://github.com/SpizzyCoder/bulkrename" class="link-info">bulkrename</a> tool to rename multiple files and so on.
      This is my first big project that I will program in Rust.
