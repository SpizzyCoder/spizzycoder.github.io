      I found myself burning ISO's to usb's.
      For this task I used the Unix tool <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/dd.c" target="_blank" class="link-info">dd</a>.
      After some time I asked myself if I could program such a "simple" tool myself.
      I have programmed rrrw at the beginning of my Rust time.
      To teach myself Rust I had to program things.
      I started with simple programs and rrrw was one of them.

      This program shows during copying how many bytes, kilobytes, megabytes etc it has copied.
      I also wanted unbuffered writing.
      Buffered writing is often (if not always) more performant.
      But if you write 1MB blocks and synchronize the stream after each write, you hardly notice the difference.
      With this, I can expect a consistent write rate.
      With dd I noticed that at the end, after it seems to have written all the bytes, it still "waits" for a while (probably synchronizes the data when closing the file).
      I didn't like this behavior.
      If I synchronize the data after each block, the file closing (data synchronization) is much faster.
